# RedCLAP documentation

This documentation is written to help programmers learn
how to create RedCLAP interfaces quickly and painlessly.
It is composed mostly of examples with descriptions explaining
the code.

This file is just an index.
For more details, read contents of any of the subdirectories.
Each subdirectory contains at least three files:

- `ui.json`: UI description,
- `program.py`: a Python program loading interface from `ui.json`,
- `README.markdown`: a short description of the example,

# Where's the "Hello World!" example?

There is a "Hello World!" example available, in the `hello_world` directory.
It has more comment lines than lines of actual code, but explains every basic
element of setting up a RedCLAP program in detail.

Other examples assume that you are familiar with the "Hello World" and
are not as heavily commented (except in sections they are designed to
explain, these *will* be heavily commented).
