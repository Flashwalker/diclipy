# Hello World!

This is the most basic program that can be written using RedCLAP.
It has only one option (taking no parameter), no subcommands, and
takes no operands (their number is not enforced).
Its sole purpose is to print the canonical "Hello World!" message to
the screen, with additional "effects" when `--verbose` option is
passed.

The program includes basic error handling, to show how to catch
interface-triggered exception when using RedCLAP.
